    "We have some fMRI time series, that we use to compute a connectivity matrix for each participant. We use the connectivity matrix values as our input features to predict to which site the participant belongs.\n",
    "We classify participants using a logistic regression. However we make several additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pipeline\n",
    "We use scikit-learn's `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`, that enables chaining several transformations into a single scikit-learn estimator (an object with a `fit` method). This avoids dealing with the connectivity feature extraction separately and ensures everything is fitted on the training data only -- which is crucial here because we will add scaling a dimensionality reduction step with Principal Component Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling\n",
    "We add scaling of the input features using scikit-learn's StandardScaler, which removes the mean and scales the features to unit variance. This helps the logistic regression solver converge faster and often improves performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "We also consider a pipeline that reduces the dimension of input features with PCA, and compare it to the baseline logistic regrssion. One advantage is that the pipeline that uses PCA can be fitted much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-validation\n",
    "Here, we will use scikit-learn's `cross_validate` to perform K-Fold cross-validation and get a better estimate of our model's generalization performance. This allows comparing logistic regression with and without PCA, as well as a naive baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, instead of the plain `LogisticRegression`, we use scikit-learn's `LogisticRegressionCV`, which automatically performs a nested cross-validation loop on the training data to select the best hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We therefore obtain a typical supervised learning experiment, with learning pipelines that involve chained transformations, hyperparameter selection, a cross-validation, and comparison of several models and a baseline.**"

Add a third estimator in the returned dictionary, which contains a dimensionality reduction step: a PCA with 20 components. To do so, add a `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` as the second step of the pipeline. Note 20 is an arbitrary choice; how could we set the number of components in a principled way?
